<h1>NoKnowledgeAuth - The Easier, Secure Cloud</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>NoKnowledgeAuth (NKA) is a proof-of-concept authentication system based on client SSL certificates that doesn&rsquo;t require users to remember any secrets.</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s much easier on your users than the typical password and secret question systems. Ordinary people just can&rsquo;t create and remember random passwords for every site.</li>
<li>This system stops attackers who can find out or guess security questions or guess or brute-force passwords. These are the same kind of attacks that have worked again and again against many celebrities, website owners, and ordinary people.</li>
<li>Because NKA uses modern crypto, malicious websites with fake login pages that can steal passwords won&rsquo;t work. You can re-use the same certificate on all websites and unlike re-used passwords, even if one site got hacked or was malicious itself, you&rsquo;ll still be secure on the other sites.</li>
<li>This system even stops advanced attackers who can &ldquo;man-in-the-middle&rdquo; your connection and strip the encryption of other sites with fraudulent certificates. Hundreds of organizations can issue certificates and many have issued bad certificates before. This system doesn&rsquo;t rely on trusting any of those organizations, since it verifies your actual key!</li>
<li>This system supports two factor (or 3 factor or 4 factor or&hellip;) authentication that&rsquo;s stronger than even other multi-factor authentication systems.</li>
<li>NKA has stronger account reset processes, using multiple devices and/or a printed or mailed reset code, not like the typical insecure account reset questions whose answers are all too easy to guess or find out.</li>
<li>NKA even supports smart cards for users that have them, for true multi-factor authentication and the highest level of security.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>It&rsquo;s time to stop blaming the victims and give people something better.</strong></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>If you have a MySQL database and an Apache HTTPS server with PHP that supports .htaccess files, just extract the noknowledgeauth directory, visit the setup.php script in your browser, and enter your database creds.</p>

<p>The below commands have been verified to work on a fresh vanilla Ubuntu server LAMP install:</p>

<pre><code>sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo a2enmod rewrite
ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/
sudo sed -ibak 's/AllowOverride None/AllowOverride All/g' /etc/apache2/apache2.conf 
cd /var/www/html
wget -O - https://scriptjunkie.us/files/noknowledgeauth.tgz | tar -xvz
sudo service apache2 restart
</code></pre>

<p>If you have the root mysql password, you can enter that into the setup.php page in your browser. This will create a database and a limited user with a randomly generated password, saving the configuration in the config.php file it generates.</p>

<p>Otherwise you will have to first create the database, db user, and config.php file yourself.</p>

<h2>Using this code in your own project</h2>

<p>This code is licensed under the <a href="LICENSE.txt">Simpified BSD license</a>, so you are free and encouraged to use it in your own projects!</p>

<p>It was written in PHP because 16 of the top 17 self-hosted content management systems are written in PHP. (<a href="http://goo.gl/OwYtYW">source</a>) This means it could easily be translated into an authentication plugin for more sites than other languages, since PHP still leads in hosting support, developer familiarity, and ease of cutting &amp; pasting code into other projects. Prefer another language? Translate into your favorite language, and post a version so even more sites can use it.</p>

<h3>Generating and issuing certificates</h3>

<p>To see how to generate and issue certificates, just check out the ca.php file and getacert.php files. The CA file has a function to create a certificate authority automatically, and another to issue a certificate. The getacert file shows how to create the frontend page that the client sees when getting a certificate.</p>

<h3>Requesting and obtaining a client&rsquo;s certificate</h3>

<p>NKA requests any client certificates by using the Apache <em>SSLVerifyClient optional_no_ca</em> directive and makes certificate data accessible to the web app with the <em>SSLOptions +StdEnvVars +ExportCertData</em> directive. Both may be set in .htaccess files unless prohibited by main apache configuration. Using optional_no_ca allows clients to use smart cards and certificates from elsewhere that are convenient for the client, but it&rsquo;s important to note that the certificate subject name cannot be taken at face value, since anybody could have issued that certificate. Instead, you&rsquo;ll have to validate the key (what NKA does) or the certificate thumbprint and keep track of which keys go with which accounts. This is a plain public/private key approach instead of a public key infrastructure approach, which in my opinion saves us a lot of complexity and is more secure.</p>

<h3>Elliptic Curve Cryptography</h3>

<p>NKA uses elliptic curve crypto where possible, for high performance and security; specifically, for the CA key (which is NOT security sensitive as it is not trusted) and in Firefox, for the client-generated certificates. I believe ECC is probably more secure than a 1024 or 2048-bit RSA key, but if you are concerned about the NSA knowing about secret weaknesses into ECC crypto, just delete the PHP lines around line 20 of getacert.php.</p>
